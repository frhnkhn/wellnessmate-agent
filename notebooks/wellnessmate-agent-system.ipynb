The project demonstrates at least **five** of the required agentic capabilities:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Multi-Agent System (Sequential + Loop Behaviour)**  \nThis project uses a structured multi-agent architecture:\n\n- **PlannerAgent** – understands the user’s query and creates an analysis plan.\n- **AnalyticsAgent** – runs the actual data analysis using tools (statistics, trends, correlations).\n- **CoachAgent** – turns numerical results into personalised wellness recommendations.\n\nThe agents run in a **sequential pipeline**:\n\n> User → PlannerAgent → AnalyticsAgent → CoachAgent → Final Output\n\nI also show a simple **loop-style behaviour**, where the system can run multiple iterations to update or refine recommendations with new data.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tools (Custom Tools + Code Execution)**  \nThe agents do not directly manipulate the raw data.  \nInstead, they call a registry of **custom tools**, such as:\n\n- `filter_by_date()`\n- `compute_basic_stats()`\n- `compute_correlations()`\n- `recent_trend()`\n- (optional) `generate_simple_plot()` using Python execution\n\nThis follows the tool-calling pattern taught in the course, where agents “take action” by calling tools rather than embedding all logic internally.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Sessions & Memory (Short-Term + Long-Term)**  \nThis system uses **two layers of memory**:\n\n- **Session memory**  \n  Stores the current conversation state and intermediate results.\n\n- **Long-term memory**  \n  Implemented as a simple JSON store that saves recurring wellness insights, such as patterns between sleep and mood.\n\nThis demonstrates how agents can use both **short-term session context** and **persistent long-term knowledge**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Observability (Logging, Tracing, Metrics)**  \nThe system logs every major action into a shared **trace**, including:\n\n- which agent ran,\n- which tools were used,\n- timestamps for each step.\n\nI also track simple **metrics**:\n\n- number of tool calls,\n- runtime,\n- number of generated recommendations.\n\nThis reflects the observability practices taught in the course (logging, tracing, metrics).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Agent Evaluation**  \nI include lightweight evaluation checks:\n\n- verifying dataset loading,\n- checking that statistical tools produce expected outputs,\n- ensuring that at least one recommendation is generated for normal queries.\n\nThis shows a basic but clear approach to **agent quality evaluation**, as required in the capstone.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## System Architecture Overview\n\n### **1. High-Level Concept**\nThe idea behind WellnessMate is simple:\n\n> “Given a user’s daily wellness logs (sleep, steps, mood, hydration, workouts),  \n> how can an AI agent system understand the user’s questions, analyze their wellness patterns,  \n> and suggest small, personalised improvements?”\n\nRather than using a single large script, the project uses multiple collaborating **agents**, each responsible for part of the workflow.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Agents in the System**\n\n#### **1. PlannerAgent**\n- Reads the user’s natural language question.  \n- Determines what type of analysis is needed (trends, correlations, general overview, etc.).  \n- Produces a simple **plan** describing which steps and tools should run.\n\n#### **2. AnalyticsAgent**\n- Takes the plan from the PlannerAgent.  \n- Uses tools to analyze the wellness dataset:\n  - compute basic statistics,\n  - extract recent trends,\n  - compute correlations between variables.\n\n#### **3. CoachAgent**\n- Takes the analysis results.  \n- Converts numerical data into practical, personalised wellness recommendations.  \n- Stores useful insights into **long-term memory** (Memory Bank style).\n\nTogether, these agents work in a **sequential pipeline**:\n> Planner → Analytics → Coach\n\n---\n\n### **3. Tools Layer**\nTo follow the agentic pattern from the course, the system uses **tools** instead of embedding logic directly in agents.\n\nExamples of custom tools:\n- `compute_basic_stats()` – mean/min/max for each metric  \n- `compute_correlations()` – checks relationships (e.g., sleep ↔ mood)  \n- `recent_trend()` – extracts the last 7/14/30 days of data  \n- `filter_by_date()` – optional date filtering  \n- `generate_plot()` – code-based tool to create charts\n\nAgents call these tools through a `tool_registry`, which imitates an MCP-style tool discovery mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Memory Layer**\n\n#### **Session Memory**\n- Tracks the current conversation.\n- Stores partial results within a single agent run.\n\n#### **Long-Term Memory**\n- A simple JSON file (`wellness_memory.json`).\n- Stores repeated or meaningful insights so the agent can re-use them across sessions.\n- Demonstrates the concept of a lightweight **Memory Bank**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Observability & Evaluation**\n\nThe system includes:\n\n- **Logging & Tracing:**  \n  Every agent action is recorded in a trace list with timestamps.\n\n- **Metrics:**  \n  For each run, the system records:\n  - tool calls count,\n  - runtime,\n  - number of recommendations generated.\n\n- **Evaluation Checks:**  \n  Small tests verify:\n  - the dataset loads,\n  - the tools return expected outputs,\n  - the agent produces suggestions.\n\nThese elements support debugging, transparency, and quality control, aligning with the course’s best practices for **agent observability**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. End-to-End Flow**\n\n> User query  \n> → PlannerAgent creates a plan  \n> → AnalyticsAgent executes tools  \n> → CoachAgent generates personalised recommendations  \n> → Logs, memory updates, and metrics recorded  \n> → Final wellness insights returned\n\nThis complete flow showcases how an AI agentic system can analyze wellness data and provide user-friendly, actionable insights.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Loading & Tool Definitions\n\nIn this section, I load the wellness dataset and define the set of **custom tools** that the agents will use.\n\nThese tools follow the action-taking pattern taught in the course:  \ninstead of hardcoding logic inside the agent, each step of work is done by a separate tool function.\n\nThe tools include:\n\n- filtering by date  \n- computing basic statistics  \n- computing correlations  \n- extracting recent trends  \n- (optional) generating plots\n\nAll tools are stored in a `tool_registry` so the agents can “call” them by name,  \nsimilar to how AI agents interact with MCP-style tools.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# --- Imports ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# --- Load the dataset ---\n\n# IMPORTANT:\n# For now, we create a placeholder DataFrame so the notebook runs.\n# Later, if you upload a real dataset to Kaggle, you can replace this part.\n\ndata_example = {\n    \"date\": pd.date_range(start=\"2024-01-01\", periods=30, freq=\"D\"),\n    \"sleep_hours\": np.random.uniform(4, 9, 30),\n    \"steps\": np.random.randint(2000, 12000, 30),\n    \"mood\": np.random.randint(1, 6, 30),  # 1 to 5 rating\n    \"water_glasses\": np.random.randint(3, 10, 30),\n    \"workout_minutes\": np.random.randint(0, 60, 30),\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data_example)\n\ndf.head()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Custom Tools\n\nThese tools perform the core data operations.  \nThe agents (Planner, Analytics, Coach) will call these tools by name via a `tool_registry`.\n\nEach tool is designed to be:\n\n- simple  \n- reusable  \n- separable from agent logic  \n\nThis is exactly the tool-based design encouraged in the course.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# --- CUSTOM TOOLS ---\n\ndef filter_by_date(df, start_date=None, end_date=None):\n    data = df.copy()\n    if start_date:\n        data = data[data[\"date\"] >= pd.to_datetime(start_date)]\n    if end_date:\n        data = data[data[\"date\"] <= pd.to_datetime(end_date)]\n    return data\n\n\ndef compute_basic_stats(df):\n    metrics = [\"sleep_hours\", \"steps\", \"mood\", \"water_glasses\", \"workout_minutes\"]\n    stats = {}\n\n    for col in metrics:\n        if col in df.columns:\n            stats[col] = {\n                \"mean\": float(df[col].mean()),\n                \"min\": float(df[col].min()),\n                \"max\": float(df[col].max()),\n            }\n    return stats\n\n\ndef compute_correlations(df):\n    numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])\n    if numeric_df.shape[1] < 2:\n        return {}\n    corr = numeric_df.corr()\n    return corr.to_dict()\n\n\ndef recent_trend(df, days=14):\n    if df.empty:\n        return df\n    cutoff = df[\"date\"].max() -

Single Entry Point: `run_wellness_agent()`\n\nThe key design choice in this project is the function:\n\n```python\nrun_wellness_agent(user_query: str) -> dict\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final Summary\n\n**WellnessMate** is a complete multi-agent system built as part of the  \n**Kaggle x Google AI Agents Intensive Capstone Project**.\n\nThis notebook demonstrates:\n\n### ✅ 1. Multi-Agent System\n- **PlannerAgent**  \n- **AnalyticsAgent**  \n- **CoachAgent**  \nEach agent has a clear role and they work together in a sequential pipeline.\n\n### ✅ 2. Tool Usage\nCustom tools handle:\n- statistics\n- correlations\n- trends\n- plotting  \nTools are managed via a `tool_registry`, following agentic tool-calling patterns.\n\n### ✅ 3. Memory & Sessions\n- **Session memory** to track the conversation.\n- **Long-term memory** using a JSON file (`wellness_memory.json`).\n\n### ✅ 4. Observability\n- Every major action is logged (agent name + message + timestamp).\n- A trace is stored and printed to inspect the agent workflow.\n- Simple runtime + tool call metrics computed for each query.\n\n### ✅ 5. Agent Evaluation\nLightweight evaluation ensures:\n- dataset is valid,\n- tools work,\n- the full agent pipeline generates useful tips.\n\n### 🚀 Why This Matters\nThis project shows how AI agents can analyze personal wellness data  \nand generate personalised insights using:\n- tools,\n- memory,\n- agent orchestration,\n- and human-readable outputs.\n\nIt also demonstrates how such a system can scale from a **prototype**  \n(notebook) into a **production-ready backend agent** with minor adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### 🎉 End of Notebook\nThanks for reviewing my capstone project!\n","metadata":{}}]}
