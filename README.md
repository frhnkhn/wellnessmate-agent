# WellnessMate: Multi-Agent Health & Wellness Assistant

This project is my capstone submission for the Kaggle x Google AI Agents Intensive.

WellnessMate is a multi-agent AI system that:

- Reads a wellness log (sleep, steps, mood, water, workouts, etc.).
- Uses multiple agents (Planner, Analytics, Coach) and custom tools.
- Analyses trends and patterns in the data.
- Generates simple, personalised wellness tips for the user.
- Uses memory, logging, and basic evaluation to demonstrate key agent concepts.
